"""
The best way to test a SQL Engine is to throw queries at it.

This is part of a suite of tests which are based on running many SQL statements.

    Run Only
 >  Shape Checking
    Results Checking
    Compare to DuckDB

This is the main SQL Battery set, others exist for testing specific features (like
reading different file types) but this is the main set of tests for if the Engine
can respond to a query.

This tests that the shape of the response is as expected: the right number of columns,
the right number of rows and, if appropriate, the right exception is thrown.

Some test blocks have labels as to what the block is generally testing, even fewer
tests have comments as to why they exist (usually if the test was written after a
bug-fix).

We have three in-memory tables, one of natural satellite data, one of planet data and
one of astronaut data. These are both small to allow us to test the SQL engine quickly
and is guaranteed to be available whereever the tests are run.

These are supplimented with a few physical tables to test conditions unable to be
tested with the in-memory tables.

We test the shape in this battery because if the shape isn't right, the response isn't
going to be right, and testing shape of an in-memory dataset is quick, so we can do 
bulk testing of 100s of queries in a few seconds and have some confidence the changes
have not broken existing functionality. Note that testing the shape doesn't mean the
response is right.

These tests only test the shape of the response, more specific tests would be needed to
test the body of the response.
